Having grown up with an over-protective and worrying father, my moving away never sat quite well with him.

After years of answering regular text messages assessing my well-being, I've decided to try out a different approach.

## The Project

The idea is to build a dashboard that my father can regularly check to ensure that I'm alive and well. Hopefully reducing his anxiety and paranoia over my inescapable impending doom.

I decided to leverage my enthusiasm for Fitbit products with my understanding of the cloud to build this.

I settled on a VueJS + ExpressJS tech stack for fast prototyping. (https://github.com/patrixr).

Here's a very basic diagram of the concept
